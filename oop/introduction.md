## Object Oriented Programming
- Break down requirements into classes, functionalities, behaviour
- Make projects more manageable and predictable
- Modularization and reusability
- Static: Belongs to class rather than instance
  - Memory efficient
  - Make common/fixed member static
  - Can be invoked without creating instance/object

## Building Blocks
### Class
- Represents a concept or logical entity
- Template or blueprint to create objects
- Non primitive data type
- Members
  - Objects, methods, instance variables, constructors
  - Access modifiers (public, private, protected, etc.)

### Object
- Instance of a class with allocated memory
- An entity with identity (unique name), state (data) and behaviour (methods)
- Can be physical or logical

### Attribute
- When objects are instantiated, individual objects contain data that is stored in attributes
- The state of an object is defined by the data in the object's attributes

### Method
- Represents behaviors and performs actions
- Promotes reusability and keeps functionality encapsulated inside an object
- Manipulates object data or attributes

## Principles
### Encapsulation
- Integration of data and operations in a class
- Hiding functional details from object
- Providing mechanics without the overhead of understanding

### Abstraction
- Incomplete class with described but unimplemented operations
- Implements functionality from abstract class
- Has-a relationship
- Interface â€“ blueprint of class

### Inheritance
- Generalizing entities
- Parent-child relationship or Is-a relationship
  - Inherits attributes and methods of the parent class
- Extends functionality of the parent class
  - Adds additional attributes & behaviors

### Polymorphism
- Multiple definitions of the same method
- Method Overloading: Differentiating behavior using number of arguments or data type
- Method Overriding: Modifying behavior in child class
