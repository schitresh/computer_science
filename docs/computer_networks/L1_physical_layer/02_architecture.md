## Line Configuration
- A link is a communication pathway that transfers data from one device to another
- Point to point connection
  - Provides a dedicated link between two devices
  - Reserves the entire capacity of the link for transmission between the two devices
- Multi-point connection
  - Multiple devices share a single link
  - Prone to network congestion
  - Types
    - Spatial sharing: Several devices can share the link simultaneously
    - Temporal sharing: Users must take turns to use the link

## Connection Types
### Peer to Peer (P2P)
- All computer linked with equal privileges
  - Special permissions are assigned to each computer for resource sharing
- Used for small setups like 10 computers
- Advantages
  - No server: less costly, easy setup & maintainence
  - No single point of failure: others will work even if one stops
- Disadvantages
  - No centralized system
  - Devices manage themselves which can be a security issue

### Client Server
- Server performs all major operations like security, network & resource management
  - All clients communicate through server
- Advantages
  - Centralized system and backup
  - Server improves overall performance including speed & security
- Disadvantages
  - Server needs resources which are costly
    - E.g. large memory, Network Operating System (NOS)
  - Requires dedicated network administrator to manage resources

## Network Types
- Primary
  - LAN (Local Area Network)
  - MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
  - WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Others
  - PAN (Personal Area Network)
  - SAN (Storage Area Network)
  - EPN (Enterprise Private Network)
  - VPN (Virtual Private Network)

## Topology
- The way in which computers, devices, and links are arranged in a network
- Mesh: Every device is connected to another device
- Star: All the devices are connected to a single hub (or central node) through a cable
- Bus: Every device is connected with extension cables to a single bi-directional cable
- Ring: All the devices are connected to each other in a cyclic manner
- Tree: A central hub is at the root, secondary hubs are the internal nodes, systems are at the leaves
- Hybrid
