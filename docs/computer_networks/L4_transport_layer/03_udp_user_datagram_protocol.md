# UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Unreliable and connectionless protocol unlike TCP
  - No need to establish connection before data transfer
  - No congestion control, no flow control
- TCP is the dominant transport layer protocol
  - That provides delivery & reliability but costs additional overhead & latency
- For real-time services like computer gaming, voice or video communication, live conferences
  - High performance is required
  - UDP permits packets to be dropped instead of processing delayed packets
  - There is no error checking which also saves bandwidth
  - Smaller packets than TCP
- Also used by DNS, DHCP, VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
- Takes datagram from network layer
  - Attaches its header and sends it to user, so it works fast
