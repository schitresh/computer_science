# Access Control Lists (ACL)
- Set of rules defined to control network traffic and reduce network attacks
  - Once a rule matches, no further comparison takes place
  - If no rule matches, then the packet is discarded
- Direction
  - Inbound access list is applied on inbound packets
  - Outbound access list is applied on outbound packets
- Only one list per interface per protocol per direction can be assigned

### Types
- Standard access list
  - Uses only the source IP address
  - Permits or denies the entire protocol suite
  - Doesn't distinguish between the IP traffic like TCP, UDP, HTTPS, etc.
- Extended access list
  - Uses source IP & port and destination IP & port
  - Can also mention which type of IP traffic should be allowed or denied
- Reflexive access list
  - Acts as a stateful firewall
    - As it allows only the traffic that is initiated within the network & its replies
    - And denies other packets coming from outside the network
  - When a session is initiated
    - It creates a temporary entry for the traffic which allows the replies from outside
  - Should be nested inside the extended access list
- Time-based access list
  - Allows access based on particular time of the day or particular days of a week
  - Can deny access to internet on working hours and allow access in lunch time
  - Can work with absolute or periodic time range
  - Best works with NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronisation
    - But can work with router clock

## Control Based Access Control (CBAC)
- Secures and protects the network from unauthorized access and malicious activity
  - Enables granular control of network policies
  - While maintaining flexibility & functionality
- Unlike traditional access control that rely on static rules & fixed conditions
  - It analyses in real time by considering a wide range of contextual factors
  - ACLs provide traffic filtering till transport layer
    - While CBAC provides till application layer
- With the help of CBAC configuration, a router can act as a firewall
- In addition to access lists
  - Maintains a state table in which the sessions are maintained in memory
    - The outbound traffic & its replies can pass the router using this state entry
  - Maintains TCP/UDP info to perform deeper inspection in packet payload
  - Examines the rate at which the connection has been established
    - To detect attacks like DoS attack, TCP syn attack and drop malicious packets
- Disadvantages
  - Filters traffic passing through
    - But not the traffic originating or terminating on the configured device
  - Inspects only TCP & UDP traffic and not ICMP or any other traffic
  - Only protects against traffic through firewall
    - And not against attacks originating within the protected network
