# Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
- Communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission
  - Including voice, video, data, and other network services
  - Over traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network
  - It can integrate speech and data on the same lines, which was not available before
- It is a circuit switched telephone network system
  - But also provides access to packet switched networks for data
    - In increments of 64 Kbit/s
  - This allows digital transmission of voice and data
  - This results in better voice or data quality than an analog phone
- Costlier than other telephone system and requires specialized digital devices

## Interfaces
- Basic Rate Interface (BRI)
  - There are two data bearing channels (B channels) and one signaling channel (D channel)
    - B (Bearer) channels
      - Operate at a max of 64 Kbps
      - Carries user data like voice, video or computer data
    - D (Data) channel
      - Operates at a max of 16 Kbps
      - Used for any combination of data, control, signaling
  - Total speed = 64 * 2 + 16 = 144 Kbps
    - 192 Kbps including 48 Kbps operating overhead of BRI service
  - The two channels are independent of each other. For example:
    - One channel is used as TCP/IP connection to a location
    - Other channel is used to send fax to a remote location
- Primary Rate Interface (PRI)
  - Consists of one D channel and either 23 or 30 B channels depending on the country
  - Both types of channel operate at 64 Kbps
  - Total speed = 1.546 Mbps (23 B channels + 1 D channel)
    - 1.544 Kbps includeing 9 Kbps overhead
- Broadband-ISDN
  - Narrowband ISDN designed to operate over the current communications infrastructure
  - Heavily dependent on copper cable, but mainly relies on the evolution of fiber optics
  - Capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate

### Services
- Bearer Services
  - Transfer of information (voice, data, video) between users
    - Without the network manipulating the content
  - No need for the network to process the information
  - Belongs to the first three layers of the OSI model
  - Provided using circuit switched, packet switched, frame switched, or cell switched networks
- Tele Services
  - Network may change or process the contents of the data
  - Corresponds to layers four to seven of the OSI model
  - Relies on the facilities of the bearer services
  - Designed to accomodate complex user needs
  - Includes telephony, teletex, telefax, videotex, telex, teleconferencing
- Supplementary Service
  - Provides additional functionality to the bearer services and the tele services
  - Examples: Reverse charging, call waiting, message handling
