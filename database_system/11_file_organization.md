## File Organization
- Data is stored in the form of tables in the database
  - But in physical memory it is stored in the form of files
- File organization refers to logical relationships among various records that constitute the file
  - Particularly with respect to identification and access to any specific record

## Types of File Organization
- Sequential File Organization
  - Pile File Method: Records are stored sequentially in the order of insertion in tables
  - Sorted File Method: Records are inserted in a sorted sequence based on primary or any other key
  - We cannot jump on a particular record, but have to move in a sequential manner
- Heap File Organization
  - Records are inserted at the end as data blocks
  - If a data block is full, the new record is stored in some other block in the memory
  - It may leave unused memory blocks
- B/B+ Tree File Organization
- Cluster File Organization
  - Related tables or records are stored within the same file known as clusters
  - Indexed clusters group records based on the cluster key
    - And hash clusters group on hash values of a key
  - These tables can be combined easily using join operation in the cluster file
  - Low performance in large databases
- Indexed Sequential Access Method
  - Data is stored sequentially but an index is maintained for faster access
  - Not as efficient as fully indexed methods for random access
  - Index maintainance can add overhead in insert & update operation

## Hashing File Organization
- For larger databases with thousands & millions of records, indexing becomes inefficient
  - Because searching a specific record consumes more time
  - Hashing can directly reach the location of a record without searching through indices
- Hash Table
  - Its size is determined by the total volume of data records in database
  - Each memory location in a hash table is called bucket
  - Each bucket stores a disk block that contains multiple records
- Hash Function
  - Mathematical function that computes the index or location within hash table for a specified record
  - It determines the speed of fetching data
  - If the hash index is already occupied, it's called collision
- Collision resolution techniques
  - Chaining
    - Records are stored as an array or linked list within an index
    - May result in bucket skew
      - If the hash function keeps generating the same index large number of times
    - The remanining data buckets will store minimal data
  - Open Addressing or Closed Hashing
    - Store the data in the next available sloto
    - Techniques like linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing can be used to find it
- Types of Hashing in DBMS
  - Static Hashing
    - Records are directly mapped to a bucket's address
  - Dynamic Hashing
    - Records are first mapped to a directory and then mapped to the buckets
    - Data buckets can be added and removed on demand dynamically
    - The buckets grow & shrink according the size of data records
    - Example: If depth is 2, consider 2 LSB as the directory
      - If hash index is 1100110, the directory will be 10

## RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks)
- Combination of multiple disks for increased performance and data redundancy
- In case of disk failure, we can retrieve the data backed up on another disk
- Key evaluation points for RAID system
  - Reliability: How many disk faults can it tolerate
  - Availability: What fraction of session time is the system in uptime mode
  - Performance: How good is response time & throughput
  - Capacity: How much useful capacity is available to user given a set of disks
- To the host system, it appears as a single big disk of linear array of blocks
  - This allows older technologies to be replaced by RAID
- Levels
  - 0: Stripping
  - 1: Mirroring
  - 2: Bit level stripping with dedicated parity
  - 3: Byte level stripping with dedicated parity
  - 4: Block level stripping with dedicated parity
  - 5: Block level stripping with distributed parity
  - 6: Block level stripping with two parity bits
